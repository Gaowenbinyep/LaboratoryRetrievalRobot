However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller","HydraulicDampingandSwingAssistanceControlofARoboticElectrohydraulicTransfemoralProsthesis:PreliminaryResultsSiyuanGao,ChentaoWang,JinyingZhu,JingengMaiandQiningWang,SeniorMember,IEEEAbstract—Thispaperpresentsaroboticelectrohydraulictransfemoralprosthesisthatconsistsofacontrollablebidi-rectionalhydraulicdampingandanelectricalactuator.Theembeddedﬁnite-statebasedcontrollerenablestheprosthesiswithhydraulicdampingadaptationinthestancephaseandmotorizedswingassistancecontrolintheswingphaseduringlevelwalking.Theproposedprosthesiswasshorterinlengththanafullypoweredtransfemoralprosthesis.Additionally,theprosthesiswithswingassistanceandbi-directionalhydraulicdampingcontrolcouldrestoreabettergaitsymmetryonkneeangleassessmentduringlevelwalking,comparedwithahydraulicmicroprocessorcontrolledtransfemoralprosthesis.Preliminaryexperimentalresultsfromatransfemoralamputeedemonstratethepotentialbeneﬁtoftheproposedtransfemoralprosthesis.I.INTRODUCTIONPeoplewithtransfemoralamputationfailtofullyac-complishtheirdailyactivities,especiallysufferfromtheinconvenienceoflocomotion","IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, VOL. 24, NO. 2, APRIL 2019\n\nDesign, Development, and Validation of a Lightweight Nonbackdrivable Robotic Ankle Prosthesis\n\nTommaso Lenzi\n\n, Member, IEEE, Marco Cempini\n\n, Member, IEEE, Levi J.

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*"]}

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg.","J Appl Physiol 107: 670–678, 2009.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","Journal of Applied Biomechanics, (Ahead of Print) https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1123\/jab.2018-0384\n\nORIGINAL RESEARCH\n\nEnergetics of Walking With a Robotic Knee Exoskeleton\n\nMhairi K.

This paper speciﬁcally focuses on the design and performance characterization of a powered wrist rotator and powered elbow joint, in addi- tion to the embedded system that controls them. In addi- tion to outlining design objectives associated with the wrist and elbow joints, this paper describes the design of both joints, and the embedded system that provides control of them and the arm system. Experimental data are presented that characterizes the performance characteristics of both joints, including data associated with electrical power con- sumption and audible noise.

Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions.","Journal of Applied Biomechanics, (Ahead of Print) https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1123\/jab.2018-0384\n\nORIGINAL RESEARCH\n\nEnergetics of Walking With a Robotic Knee Exoskeleton\n\nMhairi K.

Results from an evaluation outdoors overground on the energetics of eight subjects demonstrated a significant reduction for running when comparing Exo On to No Exo (3.9%) and for walking and running when comparing Exo On to Exo Off (12.2% and 8.2% respectively)"],"neg":["2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Singapore, May 29 - June 3, 2017\n\nSimulating Gait Assistance of a Hip Exoskeleton: Case Studies for Ankle Pathologies\n\nBokman Lim, Seungyong Hyoung, Jusuk Lee, Keehong Seo, Junwon Jang, and Youngbo Shim\n\nAbstract—We propose a simulation framework for gait assistance with ankle pathologies. We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","RESEARCH\n\nROBOTICS\n\nHuman-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking\n\nJuanjuan Zhang,1,2 Pieter Fiers,1 Kirby A. Witte,1 Rachel W. Jackson,1 Katherine L. Poggensee,1 Christopher G. Atkeson,3 Steven H. Collins1,3*\n\nExoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.\n\nF or more than a century, inventors and sci-","EffectofAssistanceTiminginKneeExtensorMuscleActivationDuringSit-to-StandUsingaBilateralRoboticKneeExoskeletonGayeonChoi1,DawitLee1,InseungKang1,andAaronJ.Young1,2Abstract—Thepopulationofolderadultsexperiencesasigniﬁcantdegradationinmusculoskeletalstructure,whichhindersdailyphysicalactivities.Standingupfromaseatedpositionisdifﬁcultformobility-challengedindividualssinceasigniﬁcantamountofkneeextensormomentisrequiredtoliftthebody’scenterofmass.Onesolutiontoreducetherequiredmuscleworkduringsit-to-standistoutilizeapoweredexoskeletonsystemthatcanproviderelevantkneeextensionassistance.However,theoptimalexoskeletonassistancestrategyformaximalbiomechanicalbeneﬁtisunknownforsit-to-standtasks.Toanswerthis,weexploredtheeffectofassistancetimingusingabilateralroboticexoskeletonontheuser’skneeextensormuscleactivation.Assistancewasprovidedatbothkneejointsfrom0%to65%ofthesit-to-standmovement,withamaximumtorqueoccurringatfourdifferenttimings(10%,25%,40%,and55%).Ourexperimentwithﬁveable-bodiedsubjectsshowedthatthemaximalbeneﬁtinkneeextensoractivation,19.3%reduction,occurredwhentheassistancetimingwasdelayedrelativetotheuser’sbiologicaljointmoment"]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","Article\n\nA hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator for studying gait assistance\n\nThe International Journal of Robotics Research 1–25 (cid:2) The Author(s) 2020 Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com\/journals-permissions DOI: 10.1177\/0278364920961452 journals.sagepub.com\/home\/ijr\n\nGwendolyn M Bryan1,2*, Patrick W Franks1,2*, Stefan C Klein1,2, Robert J Peuchen3 and Steven H Collins1,2"]}

For this time-invariant ESC, we propose a method to prove the closed loop system has an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The method is based on a perturbation theorem for maps, and, unlike existing techniques that use averaging and singular perturbation tools, it is not limited to weakly nonlinear systems. We use a typical example system to show that our method does indeed establish asymptotic stability of the limit cycle with minimal amplitude. Utilizing the example, we provide a general guide for analytic computations that are required to apply our method. The corresponding Mathematica code is available as supplementary material.\n\nIndex Terms—Extremum Seeking Control, Adaptive Control,\n\nAutonomous Systems, Limit Cycles, Perturbation Theory\n\nI.

The off-board system consists an actuation unit with two degrees of freedom that can transmit forces to our soft exosuit via Bowden cables. To perform accurate force tracking and cable slack management, we implemented a switching admittance-position control approach that utilizes the advantages of both admittance and position control. In particular, feedforward models (FFMs) are added to the admittance control to compensate variability of individual kinematics, nonlinear hip exosuit stiffness and actuator transmission loss to enable a more accurate force tracking. This system allows us to track force profiles accurately and robustly under normal walking or jogging speed. The performance of force tracking was evaluated on three subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m\/s with various magnitude, shape, and timings of assistive profiles and jogging on a treadmill at 2.3 m\/s with varied magnitude of a representative assistance profile","HydraulicDampingandSwingAssistanceControlofARoboticElectrohydraulicTransfemoralProsthesis:PreliminaryResultsSiyuanGao,ChentaoWang,JinyingZhu,JingengMaiandQiningWang,SeniorMember,IEEEAbstract—Thispaperpresentsaroboticelectrohydraulictransfemoralprosthesisthatconsistsofacontrollablebidi-rectionalhydraulicdampingandanelectricalactuator.Theembeddedﬁnite-statebasedcontrollerenablestheprosthesiswithhydraulicdampingadaptationinthestancephaseandmotorizedswingassistancecontrolintheswingphaseduringlevelwalking.Theproposedprosthesiswasshorterinlengththanafullypoweredtransfemoralprosthesis.Additionally,theprosthesiswithswingassistanceandbi-directionalhydraulicdampingcontrolcouldrestoreabettergaitsymmetryonkneeangleassessmentduringlevelwalking,comparedwithahydraulicmicroprocessorcontrolledtransfemoralprosthesis.Preliminaryexperimentalresultsfromatransfemoralamputeedemonstratethepotentialbeneﬁtoftheproposedtransfemoralprosthesis.I.INTRODUCTIONPeoplewithtransfemoralamputationfailtofullyac-complishtheirdailyactivities,especiallysufferfromtheinconvenienceoflocomotion","DesignandValidationofaBackdrivablePoweredKneeOrthosisforPartialAssistanceofLower-LimbMusculatureHanqiZhu1,ChristopherNesler2,NikhilDivekar3,VamsiPeddinti2,andRobertD.Gregg2,3Abstract—Thispaperpresentsthemechatronicdesignandvalidationofabackdrivablepoweredkneeorthosisforpartialassistanceoflower-limbmusculature,whichaimstofacilitatedailyactivitiesinindividualswithmusculoskeletaldisorders.Theactuatordesignisguidedbydesignprinciplesthatprioritizebackdrivability,outputtorque,andcompactness.First,weshowanalyticallythatincreasingthemotordiameterandreducingthetransmissionratiowhilemaintainingthedesiredoutputtorqueultimatelyreducesthereﬂectedinertia(andthusbackdrivetorque).Second,weuseencapsulatedwindingsinacustomBrushlessDCmotortoimprovethemotor’sthermalenvironmentandthusitstorqueoutput.Finally,bydesigninga7:1planetarygearsetdirectlyintothestator,theactuatorhasahighpackagefactorthatreducesthesizeandweightoftheorthosis.Benchtoptestsverifythatthecustomactuatorcanproduceapproximately23.9Nmpeaktorqueand12.78Nmcontinuoustorqueyethaslessthan2.68Nmbackdrivetorqueduringwalkingconditions.Theminimaltransmissionalsoproducesnegligibleacousticnoisedur-ingorthosisoperation"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","6640\n\nIEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 9, NO. 7, JULY 2024\n\nDesign-Modeling and Control of a Novel Wearable Exoskeleton for Lower-Limb Enhancement\n\nShuang Qiu , Student Member, IEEE, Zhongcai Pei\n\n, Jia Shi\n\n, Xu Zhang, Chen Wang, and Zhiyong Tang"]}

To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two-headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistance levels. A Time-Based Estimator (TBE) that predicted gait phase from the two previous stride durations was used to apply realistic torques during MLE training and served as a within–participant control condition. The MLE was validated online with three new participants walking at a range of speeds and torques, both interpolating within and extrapolating outside the training set. Online validation accuracy (RMSE) across tested speeds and torque levels was 3.9%.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","442\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING, VOL. 29, 2021\n\nFeasibility of Augmenting Ankle Exoskeleton Walking Performance With Step Length Biofeedback in Individuals With Cerebral Palsy\n\nYing Fang and Zachary F.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

Conventionally, measurements of body motion are obtained by motion capture cameras, of which the bulkiness and high cost make it hard to capture some movements that need broad range of space. As an alternative, inertial motion sensing using cheap and small microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been proposed. Inertial motion sensing allows ambulatory movement and is also free of occlusion problem. It has been actively studied for recent 2 decades, but until now, most researches have focused on measuring only the kinematics of body segments. In this research, the performance of inertial motion sensing especially aimed at inverse dynamics analysis is studied for squat motion. Kinematic data from inertial motion sensors are used to calculate the normal ground reaction force (GRF), which is evaluated based on the force plate measurement (ground truth) and additionally compared to the estimation result using optical motion sensing system","Malcolm et al.

Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions."]}

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","IMU-based Iterative Control for Hip Extension Assistance with a Soft Exosuit Ye Ding, Ignacio Galiana, Christopher Siviy, Fausto A.

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nAssistance magnitude versus metabolic cost reductions for a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit B.

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND BIONICS, VOL. 3, NO. 3, AUGUST 2021\n\nAdaptive Ankle Exoskeleton Control: Validation Across Diverse Walking Conditions\n\nSafoura Sadegh Pour Aji Bishe , Thang Nguyen, Ying Fang, and Zachary F.

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility. In extension and flexion, the highest γ values (γ reflects the intensity of the subject's initiative) are 3.390 and 3.705, respectively.

Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking"," Abstract— This paper proposes a new concept called “a flexible exoskeleton” and presents the design of a wearable walking assistance device to provide physical gait assistance for the elderly. To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","NEUROPROSTHETICS\n\nProprioception from a neurally controlled lower-extremity prosthesis Tyler R.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","Robotica: page 1 of 15.

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton.","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nImproving the energy economy of human running with powered and unpowered ankle exoskeleton assistance Kirby A.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg.","Miller et al.

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

The motions are generated by a series of gait states with transitions at specific intervals. The joint trajectories are planned in joint space by interpolating the joint angles of assigned gait states with the dimensions of stairs and wearer. In order to generate the adaptive motion for various dimensions of stairs, multiple sensors and motion adaption strategy with sensing information and fuzzy logic inference are developed to ensure enough foot contact area and to avoid foot-stair collisions. Simulations and experiments of the generated joint trajectories and motion adaptation strategy are conducted on a lower limb exoskeleton. Results show that the proposed joint trajectories provide smooth assistance and the generated motion successfully adapts to various size of stairs.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure","Malcolm et al.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","Malcolm et al.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."]}

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","IEEETRANSACTIONSONROBOTICS,VOL.34,NO.4,AUGUST2018953HumanoidDynamicSynchronizationThroughWhole-BodyBilateralFeedbackTeleoperationJoaoRamos"]}

Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.\n\nF or more than a century, inventors and sci-","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nImproving the energy economy of human running with powered and unpowered ankle exoskeleton assistance Kirby A.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","5440\n\nIEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 5, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2020\n\nImage Transformation and CNNs: A Strategy for Encoding Human Locomotor Intent for Autonomous Wearable Robots\n\nUng Hee Lee\n\n, Student Member, IEEE, Justin Bi, Rishi Patel\n\n, David Fouhey ,\n\nand Elliott Rouse\n\n, Member, IEEE","IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 7, NO. 2, APRIL 2022\n\nInferring Human-Robot Performance Objectives During Locomotion Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Optimal Control\n\nWentao Liu , Junmin Zhong, Ruofan Wu, Bretta L Fylstra, Jennie Si\n\n, Fellow, IEEE,\n\nand He (Helen) Huang , Senior Member, IEEE"]}

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"]}

Miller1*\n\n, Guan Rong Tan1, Emily M. Farina2, Alison L. Sheets‑Singer2 and Steven H. Collins1\n\nAbstract Background: Reducing the energy cost of running with exoskeletons could improve enjoyment, reduce fatigue, and encourage participation among novice and ageing runners. Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."," Abstract— Individuals with lower limb amputations show higher metabolic costs during ambulation than able-bodied individuals. This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers.

Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs).

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure","ASSISTIVE DEVICE\n\nReducing the metabolic cost of running with a tethered soft exosuit G.

Studies have shown that distance running per- formance is linearly correlated with metabolic cost, and there has been an increased interest in the robotics community to develop wear- able exoskeletons to further augment human performance by reducing metabolic cost.","Bryan et al.\n\nRESEARCH\n\nOptimized hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance reduces the metabolic cost of walking with worn loads Gwendolyn M.

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg."]}

The control system was implemented on a powered prosthesis and evaluated on a single unilateral transtibial amputee subject. The ability of the prosthesis to provide appropriate functionality during stair ascent and descent was assessed by comparing gait kinematics and kinetics of the prosthesis to those of a passive dynamic elastic response prosthesis and those of a set of non- amputee subjects. Data from the assessment indicates that the powered prosthesis is able to provide some desirable stair ascent and stair descent characteristics,relative to the passive prosthesis.\n\nIndex\n\nTerms—Powered\n\nprosthesis,\n\ntranstibial\n\nprosthesis, stair ascent, stair descent.\n\nI.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators.

Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs).

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS. PREPRINT VERSION. ACCEPTED JUNE, 2020 1  Abstract— Lower-limb exoskeletons are widely researched to improve walking performance and mobility. Low-level sensor-less exoskeleton motor control is attractive for consumer applications due to reduced device complexity and cost, but complex and variable transmission system configurations make the development of effective open-loop motor controllers that are responsive to user input challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an open-loop motor control framework resulting in similar or greater performance vs. closed-loop torque control. We used generalized linear regression to develop two open-loop controllers by modeling motor current during exoskeleton-assisted walking; a “complex” model used desired torque and estimated ankle angular velocity as inputs, while a “simple” model used desired torque alone.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives.

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","Journal of Physics: Conference SeriesBiomechanics of front and back squat exercisesTo cite this article: A A Braidot et al 2007 J.

In addition, the framework of several BLS variants with their mathematical modeling is given. The variations include cascade, recurrent, and broad–deep combination structures.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","184\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING, VOL. 30, 2022\n\nDesign and Experimental Evaluation of a Lower-Limb Exoskeleton for Assisting Workers With Motorized Tuning of Squat Heights\n\nYao Tu , Aibin Zhu , Member,IEEE, Jiyuan Song, Xiaodong Zhang, Member,IEEE, and Guangzhong Cao , SeniorMember,IEEE","2722\n\nIEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, VOL. 25, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2020\n\nReal-Time Locomotion Mode Recognition and Assistive Torque Control for Unilateral Knee Exoskeleton on Different Terrains\n\nXiuhua Liu and Qining Wang , Senior Member, IEEE"]}

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nImproving the energy economy of human running with powered and unpowered ankle exoskeleton assistance Kirby A.

Miller1*\n\n, Guan Rong Tan1, Emily M. Farina2, Alison L. Sheets‑Singer2 and Steven H. Collins1\n\nAbstract Background: Reducing the energy cost of running with exoskeletons could improve enjoyment, reduce fatigue, and encourage participation among novice and ageing runners. Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","opEN\n\nData DEScRiptoR\n\nLower-limb kinematics and kinetics during continuously varying human locomotion\n\nEmma Reznick Nicholas P.

Over the past few years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of control individualization for such gait assistive devices to maximize benefit to the wearer. In this paper, we present an updated version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit, including an online parameter tuning method that customizes control parameters for each individual based on positive ankle augmentation power."]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external","OPEN\n\nMuscle coordination and recruitment during squat assistance using a robotic ankle–foot exoskeleton\n\nHyeongkeun Jeong , Parian Haghighat , Prakyath Kantharaju , Michael Jacobson , Heejin Jeong & Myunghee Kim *"]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

This article proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) based on BLS to tackle the noise and outliers in an industrial process. WBLS provides a uniﬁed framework for easily using different methods of calculating the weighted penalty factor. Using the weighted penalty factor to constrain the contribution of each sample to modeling, the normal and abnormal samples were allocated higher and lower weights to increase and decrease their contributions, respectively. Hence, the WBLS can eliminate the bad effect of noise and outliers"]}

However, existing assist devices pose problems in terms of coordination between the person and the device owing to misalignment of motion time or device motion trajectory. Therefore, an assist method with a wide range of tolerance for such misalignment is required. In a previous study focusing on viscosity characteristics, the basic assist effect of viscosity in seated motion was verified and its effectiveness was demonstrated. Consequently, the viscosity command was able to provide assistance with a wider range of tolerance for movement time and misalignment between the motion trajectory of the device and the wearer than other command methods.

An assist method was developed that coordinates the walk ratio of users while increasing their propulsive force. This assist method was implemented through a hardware system that consists of low-profile actuators and compact electrical components. The device is light and adaptable to users of various shape and size. A long-term experiment showed that elderly subjects using the walking assist device were eventually able to walk with a wider stride, at a higher speed, and with a lower heart rate, without help from the device.

In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","IEEEROBOTICSANDAUTOMATIONLETTERS.PREPRINTVERSION.ACCEPTEDFEBRUARY,20181AnklePathologicGaitAssistanceofaHipExoskeleton:SimulationandExperimentBokmanLim∗1,SunHeeHwang∗2,SeungyongHyung1,JusukLee1,YoungboShim1,andByung-okChoi2Abstract—Thispaperpresentsasimulationframeworkforhipassistanceinanklepathologies.Weﬁrstconstructedtheneuromuscularwalkingmodel,thendesignedtheparametersforassistancetorquesforstanceandswinglegs.Theparametervaluesweredeterminedbycarryingoutdynamicoptimizationswhichtakesintoaccountthehuman-exoskeletoninteractivedynamics.Thecasestudiesinvolvedabnormalgaitswith1)footdrop,and2)footdropandplantarﬂexionfailure.WeconductedclinicaltrialsonCharcot-Marie-Tooth(CMT)patientswithvariousdegreeofseverityusingtheassistancetorquegeneratedbythesimulation.Weevaluatedthegaitspeedfordifferentgaittypeswithdifferentassistancetimings.Ourresultsshowthattheassistancecustomizationofvariousgaittypesisessentialformaximizingtheassistanceeffect.IndexTerms—Physicalhuman-robotinteraction,wearablerobots,pathologicgaitsimulation,assistancecustomization.I.INTRODUCTIONABNORMALgaitpatternswithanklepathologiesareobservedinpatientsorelderlywithgaitdisorders"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs.

Ishmael, Minh Tran, Student Member, IEEE, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE\n\n(cid:2)\n\nAbstract(cid:2) In this paper, we explore the effect of residual hip assistance in one above-knee amputee subject using a novel lightweight powered hip exoskeleton. Differently from a powered prosthesis, a powered hip exoskeleton adds mass proximally. Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton. Experimental results show 20.5% reduction of PCI when walking with the powered hip exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","AssistancestrategyforstairascentwitharobotichipexoskeletonJunwonJang,KyungrockKim,JusukLee,BokmanLimandYoungboShimAbstract—Inthispaper,weproposeanovelassistancestrat-egyforstairascentwalkingusingourrobotichipexoskeleton.Ourstrategyexploitsfootcontacteventestimatedbyaninertialmeasurementunit(IMU)andcandetectuserintentionaswellasreﬂectuserpreference.Inourstrategy,agaitcycleisdividedinto4phasesandthetransitionsbetweenthephasesarebasedoneventsthatareunavoidableandcanbedetectedreliablyusingthesensorsavailableforourexoskeleton.Theproposedstrategypresentscriteriafortheinitiationandterminationofassistancebyrecognizinguserintention,aswellasmethodstoadjustthetimingandtheamountofassistancecorrespondingtouserpreference.Wheneachstepstarts,thedurationofassistanceisdeterminedandthetorqueproﬁleforthewholestepisplannedahead.Wedemonstratethevalidityoftheproposedstrategyforstairascentandexamineitseffectsonhipjointangletrajectorythroughexperimentalresults.I.INTRODUCTIONStairascentisoneofthemostchallengingandcriticalactivitiesofdailylivingforelderlypeople.Recentlymanystudiesforwalkingassistanceactivityhavebeenperformedintheformofroboticlowerlimbexoskeletons[1]–[5]"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90: 136-44.\n\nObjectives: To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM move- ment during gait.\n\nDesign: Randomized repeated measures. Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of\n\nMichigan.\n\nParticipants: Able-bodied subjects (N(cid:1)10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m\/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displace- ments, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxy- gen consumption to calculated metabolic power.","Downloaded from https:\/\/www.science.org at North Carolina State University on May 07, 2022\n\nRESEARCH\n\nenergy? This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","Bryan et al.\n\nRESEARCH\n\nOptimized hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance reduces the metabolic cost of walking with worn loads Gwendolyn M.

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg."]}

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"]}

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nAssistance magnitude versus metabolic cost reductions for a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit B.

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Ishmael, Minh Tran, Student Member, IEEE, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE\n\n(cid:2)\n\nAbstract(cid:2) In this paper, we explore the effect of residual hip assistance in one above-knee amputee subject using a novel lightweight powered hip exoskeleton. Differently from a powered prosthesis, a powered hip exoskeleton adds mass proximally. Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton. Experimental results show 20.5% reduction of PCI when walking with the powered hip exoskeleton. I.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Gait simulation results are presented that indicate the majority of load bearing and the majority of power for gait is provided by the legs (i.e., quadriceps muscle stimulation). Based on these simulations, experiments on healthy subjects indicate that the gait restoration approach should be capable of providing long periods of locomotion unimpeded by quadriceps muscle fatigue. I. INTRODUCTION REVIOUS studies have demonstrated that functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used for restoring gait to people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Standing and walking can provide significant physiological and psychological benefits to those with SCI [1-9]. However, electrically stimulated muscles suffer from rapid fatigue [10], relatively poor controllability of stimulated muscles, and the inability to control degrees-of-freedom outside the sagittal plane. Hybrid systems, which combine FES with an orthosis, can address several of the shortcomings of FES-aided gait","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton.","Bryan et al.\n\nRESEARCH\n\nOptimized hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance reduces the metabolic cost of walking with worn loads Gwendolyn M.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

Conventionally, measurements of body motion are obtained by motion capture cameras, of which the bulkiness and high cost make it hard to capture some movements that need broad range of space. As an alternative, inertial motion sensing using cheap and small microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been proposed. Inertial motion sensing allows ambulatory movement and is also free of occlusion problem. It has been actively studied for recent 2 decades, but until now, most researches have focused on measuring only the kinematics of body segments. In this research, the performance of inertial motion sensing especially aimed at inverse dynamics analysis is studied for squat motion. Kinematic data from inertial motion sensors are used to calculate the normal ground reaction force (GRF), which is evaluated based on the force plate measurement (ground truth) and additionally compared to the estimation result using optical motion sensing system","Real-TimeContinuousGaitPhaseandSpeedEstimationfromaSingleSensorDavidQuintero1,2,DanielJ.Lambert3,DarioJ.Villarreal2,andRobertD.Gregg2,1Abstract—Humangaitinvolvesarepetitivecycleofmove-ments,andthephaseofgaitrepresentsthelocationinthiscycle.Gaitphaseismeasuredacrossmanyareasofstudy(e.g.,foranalyzinggaitandcontrollingpoweredlower-limbprostheticandorthoticdevices).Currentgaitphasedetectionmethodsmeasurediscretegaitevents(e.g.,heelstrike,ﬂatfoot,toeoff,etc.)byplacingmultiplesensorsonthesubject’slower-limbs.Usingmultiplesensorscancreatedifﬁcultyinexperimentalsetupandreal-timedataprocessing.Inaddition,detectingonlydiscreteeventsduringthegaitcyclelimitstheamountofinformationavailableduringlocomotion.Inthispaperweproposeareal-timeandcontinuousmeasurementofgaitphaseparameterizedbyamechanicalvariable(i.e.,phasevariable)fromasinglesensormeasuringthehumanthighmotion.Humansubjectexperimentsdemonstratetheabilityofthephasevariabletoaccuratelyparameterizegaitprogressionfordifferentwalking\/runningspeeds(1to9miles\/hour).Ourresultsshowthatthisreal-timemethodcanalsoestimategaitspeedfromthesamesensor.I.INTRODUCTIONHumangaitanalysisinvolvesstudyingjointkinematicsandkineticsduringlocomotion","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Shull\n\n, Member, IEEE","Abstract— This paper presents a modular, computationally-distributed “multi-robot” cyberphysical system designed to assist children with developmental delays in learning to walk. The system consists of two modules, each assisting a different aspect of gait: a tethered cable pelvic module with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), which can modulate the motion of the pelvis in three dimensions, and a two DOF wearable hip module assisting lower limb motion, specifically hip flexion. Both modules are designed to be lightweight and minimally restrictive to the user, and the modules can operate independently or in cooperation with each other, allowing flexible system configuration to provide highly customized and adaptable assistance. Motion tracking performance of approximately 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error for the pelvic module and less than 0.1 mm RMS error for the hip module was achieved. We demonstrate coordinated operation of the two modules on a mannequin test platform with articulated and instrumented lower limbs. I.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons.

In fuzzy broad learning system, artiﬁcial parameters selec- tion of ridge regression might result in the decrease in testing accuracy. To overcome this shortcoming of fuzzy broad learning system, this article builds a novel model of fuzzy broad learning system based on acceler- ating amount by introducing the accelerating amount into fuzzy broad learning system. The theoretical result on the universal approximation property of fuzzy broad learning system based on accelerating amount is presented.

BLS has attracted increasing attention from many scholars owing to its excellent performance. This article proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) based on BLS to tackle the noise and outliers in an industrial process. WBLS provides a uniﬁed framework for easily using different methods of calculating the weighted penalty factor. Using the weighted penalty factor to constrain the contribution of each sample to modeling, the normal and abnormal samples were allocated higher and lower weights to increase and decrease their contributions, respectively. Hence, the WBLS can eliminate the bad effect of noise and outliers","IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 7, NO. 2, APRIL 2022\n\nInferring Human-Robot Performance Objectives During Locomotion Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Optimal Control\n\nWentao Liu , Junmin Zhong, Ruofan Wu, Bretta L Fylstra, Jennie Si\n\n, Fellow, IEEE,\n\nand He (Helen) Huang , Senior Member, IEEE","A Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Solution Framework for Optimal and Adaptive Personalization of a Hip Exoskeleton\n\nXikai Tu, Minhan Li, Ming Liu, Jennie Si, Fellow, IEEE and He (Helen) Huang, Senior Member, IEEE\n\n"]}

J Strength Cond Res 24(12): 3497–3506, 2010—The squat is one of the most frequently used exercises in the ﬁeld of strength and conditioning. Considering the complexity of the exercise and the many variables related to performance, understanding squat biomechanics is of great importance for both achieving optimal muscular development as well as reducing the prospect of a training-related injury. Therefore, the purpose of this article is 2-fold: ﬁrst, to examine kinematics and kinetics of the dynamic squat with respect to the ankle, knee, hip and spinal joints and, second, to provide recommendations based on these bio- mechanical factors for optimizing exercise performance.\n\nKEY WORDS squat, biomechanics, kinetics, kinematics\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nT he squat","opEN\n\nData DEScRiptoR\n\nLower-limb kinematics and kinetics during continuously varying human locomotion\n\nEmma Reznick Nicholas P.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

An assist method was developed that coordinates the walk ratio of users while increasing their propulsive force. This assist method was implemented through a hardware system that consists of low-profile actuators and compact electrical components. The device is light and adaptable to users of various shape and size. A long-term experiment showed that elderly subjects using the walking assist device were eventually able to walk with a wider stride, at a higher speed, and with a lower heart rate, without help from the device. Their balance of muscular usage also changed accordingly. Energy consumption increased according to the increase in the subjects’ speed. This result suggests the possibility of using the walking assist device as a tool for increasing elderly peoples’ physical activity, while reducing the level of stress this would normally produce.","WalkingSupportbasedonCooperationbetweenWearable-TypeandCane-TypeWalkingSupportSystemsShinjiSuzuki,YasuhisaHirata,KazuhiroKosugeandHiroshiOnoderaAbstract—Inthispaper,weproposeanewwalkingsup-portsystembasedoncooperationbetweenwearable-typeandcane-typewalkingsupportsystemsforsupportinghemiplegiapatients.Inthissystem,wewanttorealizeseveralfunctionssuchasswingphasesupport,navigation,fallpreventionandsit-to-standassistbycontrollingeachwalkingsupportsystemcooperatively.Astheﬁrstchallengeofourresearch,inthispaper,thewearable-typewalkingsupportsystemassistsalegmotionduringswingphasebasedonthemotionofthecane-typewalkingsupportsystemmovedbytheuser.I.INTRODUCTIONRecently,manyroboticsresearchershavedevelopedvar-iouswearable-typewalkingsupportsystemforthepurposeofenhancementofphysicalcapabilityforhealthysubjectsorwalkingsupportfortheelderlyandphysicallydisabledpeo-ple.BerkeleyBionicsdevelopedtheHULCforenhancementofphysicalcapabilityofsoldiers[1].Thissystemenhancestheuser’sphysicalcapabilitybycarryingaheavyloadinsteadoftheuser.Ikeuchietal.developedbodyweightsupportsystemforreducinglegloadappliedbyuser’sbodyweight[2].Sankaietal","323978-1-7281-7711-3\/22\/$31.00 ©2022 IEEE\n\nEvaluation of Torque-Sensorless Control for a Knee Exoskeleton Using Back-Drivable Actuators\n\nKenichiro Mori Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Yokohama National University Email: mori-kenichiro-dx@ynu.jp\n\nYasutaka Fujimoto Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Yokohama National University Email: fujimoto@ynu.ac.jp\n\n2 6 2 9 2 7 9 2 2 0 2 7 3 6 1 5 C M A \/ 9 0 1 1 0 1 : I"]}

An assist method was developed that coordinates the walk ratio of users while increasing their propulsive force. This assist method was implemented through a hardware system that consists of low-profile actuators and compact electrical components. The device is light and adaptable to users of various shape and size. A long-term experiment showed that elderly subjects using the walking assist device were eventually able to walk with a wider stride, at a higher speed, and with a lower heart rate, without help from the device.

This result suggests the possibility of using the walking assist device as a tool for increasing elderly peoples’ physical activity, while reducing the level of stress this would normally produce."," Abstract— This paper proposes a new concept called “a flexible exoskeleton” and presents the design of a wearable walking assistance device to provide physical gait assistance for the elderly. To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure","Lee et al.

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","OPEN\n\nMuscle coordination and recruitment during squat assistance using a robotic ankle–foot exoskeleton\n\nHyeongkeun Jeong , Parian Haghighat , Prakyath Kantharaju , Michael Jacobson , Heejin Jeong & Myunghee Kim *","DesignandcontrolofanovelpoweredwearablekneeexoskeletonforlowerlimbrehabilitationKuiDu1,2,YangYu2,3andLinDong2,3#Abstract—Lowerlimbrehabilitationisacrucialaspectofrecoveryfollowingvariousinjuriesandmusculoskeletaldis-orders.Traditionaltechniques,whileeffective,canbetime-consumingandrequireintensivetherapistinvolvement.Pow-eredwearablekneeexoskeletonsofferapromisingsolutionbyprovidingtargetedtorqueassistanceduringrehabilitationexercises.Thispaperpresentsthedesignandcontrolofanovelpoweredwearablekneeexoskeletonspecificallytailoredforlowerlimbrehabilitationapplications.Theexoskeletonprioritizesusercomfort,safety,andeaseofuse.Wedelveintothemechanicaldesignconsiderationsforachievinglightweightconstruction,comfortablewearability,andsuitablerangeofmotion.Subsequently,weelaborateonthecontrolalgorithmemployedonthekneeexoskeleton,focusingonitsabilitytoimproverehabilitationefficiency.I.INTRODUCTIONLowerlimbrehabilitationisacriticalaspectofrecoveryfollowingawiderangeofinjuriesandmusculoskeletaldisorders,includingstroke,ligamenttears,andosteoarthritis[1]"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

In this paper, we present a new version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance, particularly designed for overground walking. The soft exosuit assists with ankle plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension, equally distributing the forces between ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. A mobile actuation system was developed to generate high assistive forces, and Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces to the exosuit. A sensor harness connects two load cells and three IMUs per leg that are used to measure real-time data for a controller that commands desired force profiles as a function of the walking cycle. In addition, a control adaptation method was developed which adjusts control parameters while walking on irregular surfaces.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","1836\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING, VOL. 27, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2019\n\nLocomotion Mode Recognition With Robotic Transtibial Prosthesis in Inter-Session and Inter-Day Applications\n\nEnhao Zheng, Member,IEEE, Qining Wang , SeniorMember,IEEE, and Hong Qiao , Fellow,IEEE"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*"]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","AssistancestrategyforstairascentwitharobotichipexoskeletonJunwonJang,KyungrockKim,JusukLee,BokmanLimandYoungboShimAbstract—Inthispaper,weproposeanovelassistancestrat-egyforstairascentwalkingusingourrobotichipexoskeleton.Ourstrategyexploitsfootcontacteventestimatedbyaninertialmeasurementunit(IMU)andcandetectuserintentionaswellasreﬂectuserpreference.Inourstrategy,agaitcycleisdividedinto4phasesandthetransitionsbetweenthephasesarebasedoneventsthatareunavoidableandcanbedetectedreliablyusingthesensorsavailableforourexoskeleton.Theproposedstrategypresentscriteriafortheinitiationandterminationofassistancebyrecognizinguserintention,aswellasmethodstoadjustthetimingandtheamountofassistancecorrespondingtouserpreference.Wheneachstepstarts,thedurationofassistanceisdeterminedandthetorqueproﬁleforthewholestepisplannedahead.Wedemonstratethevalidityoftheproposedstrategyforstairascentandexamineitseffectsonhipjointangletrajectorythroughexperimentalresults.I.INTRODUCTIONStairascentisoneofthemostchallengingandcriticalactivitiesofdailylivingforelderlypeople.Recentlymanystudiesforwalkingassistanceactivityhavebeenperformedintheformofroboticlowerlimbexoskeletons[1]–[5]","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nMEDICAL ROBOTS Human-in-the-loop optimization of hip assistance with a soft exosuit during walking Ye Ding,1,2* Myunghee Kim,1,2* Scott Kuindersma,1† Conor J.

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility. In extension and flexion, the highest γ values (γ reflects the intensity of the subject's initiative) are 3.390 and 3.705, respectively.

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2022 1 Abstract— The widespread adoption of powered lower-limb exoskeletons for augmenting mobility requires energy-efficient actuation to provide meaningful assistance over relevant walking durations. We designed, modeled, and validated an ankle exoskeleton design with a parallel elastic element in the form of a carbon fiber leaf spring that stored and returned energy in parallel to a cable-drive ankle joint during stance phase. We assessed the impact of the parallel elastic element on the performance of the untethered robotic ankle exoskeleton at walking speeds of 0.75-1.25 m\/s using a previously validated-controller, and a controller designed specifically to maximize the spring’s benefit. The spring selected for our adult cohort had a stiffness of 97.2 Nm\/rad, engaged best at 0-degrees ankle dorsiflexion, and produced 10-15 Nm peak assistive torque at all walking speeds. When tracking the previously validated exoskeleton controller, peak motor current was reduced by 14-20% and integrated current was reduced by 16-19% for parallel-elastic design vs"," Abstract— Active lower limb exoskeletons can provide assistance to the lower extremities and may drastically improve the walking abilities of millions of individuals with gait impairments. However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","1442\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS, VOL. 38, NO. 3, JUNE 2022\n\nModeling and Stiffness-Based Continuous Torque Control of Lightweight Quasi-Direct-Drive Knee Exoskeletons for Versatile Walking Assistance\n\nTzu-Hao Huang , Sainan Zhang , Shuangyue Yu , Mhairi K.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","Experimental Effective Shape Control of a Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis\n\nRobert D.

White Penn State Erie, The Behrend College\n\nTraditionally, robotics are created to be user friendly from a human standpoint but recently a different theory has emerged which focuses on how the technology we use may influence how human-like we perceive each other to be. This study investigates how individual differences play in to someone’s propensity to technomorphize. The first focus was on whether those in an engineering or programming field were more likely to technomorphize than those in other fields. The second focus was to continue the validation process for the technomorphism scale and examine how machine-like humans may be perceived. Results from this study showed that those in an engineering field or programming field are more likely to technomorphize than those in different fields.\n\nINTRODUCTION","Article\n\nA hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator for studying gait assistance\n\nThe International Journal of Robotics Research 1–25 (cid:2) The Author(s) 2020 Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com\/journals-permissions DOI: 10.1177\/0278364920961452 journals.sagepub.com\/home\/ijr\n\nGwendolyn M Bryan1,2*, Patrick W Franks1,2*, Stefan C Klein1,2, Robert J Peuchen3 and Steven H Collins1,2","SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nImproving the energy economy of human running with powered and unpowered ankle exoskeleton assistance Kirby A.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","Article\n\nA hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator for studying gait assistance\n\nThe International Journal of Robotics Research 1–25 (cid:2) The Author(s) 2020 Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com\/journals-permissions DOI: 10.1177\/0278364920961452 journals.sagepub.com\/home\/ijr\n\nGwendolyn M Bryan1,2*, Patrick W Franks1,2*, Stefan C Klein1,2, Robert J Peuchen3 and Steven H Collins1,2"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."," Abstract— This paper proposes a new concept called “a flexible exoskeleton” and presents the design of a wearable walking assistance device to provide physical gait assistance for the elderly. To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure","A textile exomuscle that assists the shoulder during functional movements for everyday life\n\nAnna-Maria Georgarakis\n\n1,2 ✉, Michele Xiloyannis\n\n1,2, Peter Wolf\n\n1 and Robert Riener\n\n1,2"]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.","Robust and Adaptive Lower Limb Prosthesis Control via Extended Kalman Filter-Based Phase Estimation\n\nNitish Thatte, Tanvi Shah, and Hartmut Geyer"]}

Humans can generate diverse locomotion behaviors through the hierarchical control of the supraspinal and the spinal systems, where the spinal control is often assumed to consist of central pattern generators and reﬂexes. It has been demonstrated through simulation that human walking and running can be generated with control models where the central pattern generator is controlled in a hierarchical structure. How- ever, no reﬂex control model in such framework has been proposed. Here we propose that locomotion behaviors can be controlled by a hierarchical control structure where the supraspinal system modulates reﬂexes with simple signals. We demonstrate in physics simulation that a simple neu- romuscular model with a hierarchical reﬂex control can regulate running speed and height on unknown terrains with height diﬀerences of ±10cm.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction"]}

Direct comparison studies are needed to determine how users respond to different types of control. The purpose of this study was to compare user performance using a robotic hip exoskeleton with two different controllers: a controller that targeted a biological hip torque profile and a proportional myoelectric controller.\n\nEdited by: Jan Veneman, Tecnalia, Spain"]}

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton.","RESEARCH\n\nROBOTICS\n\nHuman-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking\n\nJuanjuan Zhang,1,2 Pieter Fiers,1 Kirby A.

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.\n\nF or more than a century, inventors and sci-"," Abstract— This paper proposes a new concept called “a flexible exoskeleton” and presents the design of a wearable walking assistance device to provide physical gait assistance for the elderly. To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"]}

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","5440\n\nIEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 5, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2020\n\nImage Transformation and CNNs: A Strategy for Encoding Human Locomotor Intent for Autonomous Wearable Robots\n\nUng Hee Lee\n\n, Student Member, IEEE, Justin Bi, Rishi Patel\n\n, David Fouhey ,\n\nand Elliott Rouse\n\n, Member, IEEE"]}

Specifically, we monitor the vertical acceleration with an abdomen-mounted IMU at the moment of maximum hip extension.

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I.

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","Proceedings of the RAAD 2012 21st International Workshop on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region September 10-13, 2012, Napoli, Italy\n\nMetabolic Cost of Squatting using Robotic Knee Exoskeleton\n\nAndrej Gams, Tadej Debevec, Tadej Petriˇc and Jan Babiˇc\n\nDepartment for automation, biocybernetics and robotics Joˇzef Stefan Institute Jamova cesta 39, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia E-mail: andrej.gams@ijs.si"]}

Because joint torque is related to gait speed, it is important to consider the user’s gait speed when determining the magnitude of assistive joint torque. We developed and tested a novel exoskeleton controller for delivering propulsive assistance which modulates exoskeleton torque magnitude based on both soleus muscle activity and walking speed. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the resulting exoskeleton assistance on post-stroke walking performance across a range of walking speeds."],"neg":["Article\n\nA hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator for studying gait assistance\n\nThe International Journal of Robotics Research 1–25 (cid:2) The Author(s) 2020 Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com\/journals-permissions DOI: 10.1177\/0278364920961452 journals.sagepub.com\/home\/ijr\n\nGwendolyn M Bryan1,2*, Patrick W Franks1,2*, Stefan C Klein1,2, Robert J Peuchen3 and Steven H Collins1,2","opEN\n\nData DEScRiptoR\n\nLower-limb kinematics and kinetics during continuously varying human locomotion\n\nEmma Reznick Nicholas P.

In this optimization process, metabolic estimation from muscle synergies is adopted for enhancing optimization speed and minimizing the dimension of signals.

Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of\n\nMichigan.\n\nParticipants: Able-bodied subjects (N(cid:1)10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m\/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displace- ments, joint torques, and work.

The efficacy of the controller and SCSA prosthesis prototype in providing improved stair ambulation was tested on a unilateral transfemoral amputee in experiments that employed motion capture apparatus to compare joint kinematics with the SCSA prosthesis, relative to performing the same activity with a microprocessor-controlled daily-use passive prosthesis. Results suggest that the SCSA knee significantly decreases compensatory motion during stair activity when compared to the passive prosthesis. I. INTRODUCTION Many tasks of daily living are often more difficult for persons with transfemoral amputation than for their age-matched non-amputee counterparts [1, 2]. One task frequently performed either in the home or in daily life which has been shown to be exceptionally difficult for persons with amputation is traversing stairs [3]","DesignandcontrolofanovelpoweredwearablekneeexoskeletonforlowerlimbrehabilitationKuiDu1,2,YangYu2,3andLinDong2,3#Abstract—Lowerlimbrehabilitationisacrucialaspectofrecoveryfollowingvariousinjuriesandmusculoskeletaldis-orders.Traditionaltechniques,whileeffective,canbetime-consumingandrequireintensivetherapistinvolvement.Pow-eredwearablekneeexoskeletonsofferapromisingsolutionbyprovidingtargetedtorqueassistanceduringrehabilitationexercises.Thispaperpresentsthedesignandcontrolofanovelpoweredwearablekneeexoskeletonspecificallytailoredforlowerlimbrehabilitationapplications.Theexoskeletonprioritizesusercomfort,safety,andeaseofuse.Wedelveintothemechanicaldesignconsiderationsforachievinglightweightconstruction,comfortablewearability,andsuitablerangeofmotion.Subsequently,weelaborateonthecontrolalgorithmemployedonthekneeexoskeleton,focusingonitsabilitytoimproverehabilitationefficiency.I.INTRODUCTIONLowerlimbrehabilitationisacriticalaspectofrecoveryfollowingawiderangeofinjuriesandmusculoskeletaldisorders,includingstroke,ligamenttears,andosteoarthritis[1]"," Abstract— This paper describes the design, implementation, and preliminary validation of a controller for a powered lower-limb exoskeleton that reshapes a user’s leg movement during over-ground walking. The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller"]}

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller","AssistancestrategyforstairascentwitharobotichipexoskeletonJunwonJang,KyungrockKim,JusukLee,BokmanLimandYoungboShimAbstract—Inthispaper,weproposeanovelassistancestrat-egyforstairascentwalkingusingourrobotichipexoskeleton.Ourstrategyexploitsfootcontacteventestimatedbyaninertialmeasurementunit(IMU)andcandetectuserintentionaswellasreﬂectuserpreference.Inourstrategy,agaitcycleisdividedinto4phasesandthetransitionsbetweenthephasesarebasedoneventsthatareunavoidableandcanbedetectedreliablyusingthesensorsavailableforourexoskeleton.Theproposedstrategypresentscriteriafortheinitiationandterminationofassistancebyrecognizinguserintention,aswellasmethodstoadjustthetimingandtheamountofassistancecorrespondingtouserpreference.Wheneachstepstarts,thedurationofassistanceisdeterminedandthetorqueproﬁleforthewholestepisplannedahead.Wedemonstratethevalidityoftheproposedstrategyforstairascentandexamineitseffectsonhipjointangletrajectorythroughexperimentalresults.I.INTRODUCTIONStairascentisoneofthemostchallengingandcriticalactivitiesofdailylivingforelderlypeople.Recentlymanystudiesforwalkingassistanceactivityhavebeenperformedintheformofroboticlowerlimbexoskeletons[1]–[5]","Regulating Speed and Generating Large Speed Transitions in a Neuromuscular Human Walking Model\n\nSeungmoon Song and Hartmut Geyer Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University\n\nW911NR-11-1-0098\n\nLocal Reflex Control Has a Large Potential for Controlling Robotic Legs\n\nCPG\n\nReflex\n\nHumanoid vs Human Control\n\nLocal Reflex Control\n\nHumanoid: HONDA (ASIMO), Boston Dynamics (PETMAN)\n\nCPG + reflex: Taga et al.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

This paper speciﬁcally focuses on the design and performance characterization of a powered wrist rotator and powered elbow joint, in addi- tion to the embedded system that controls them. In addi- tion to outlining design objectives associated with the wrist and elbow joints, this paper describes the design of both joints, and the embedded system that provides control of them and the arm system. Experimental data are presented that characterizes the performance characteristics of both joints, including data associated with electrical power con- sumption and audible noise. The arm prosthesis described here is intended to be used with a multigrasp hand prosthe- sis, previously published by the authors.\n\nIndex Terms—Artiﬁcial\n\nlimbs, medical\n\nrobotics,\n\nprosthetics."]}

J Strength Cond Res 24(12): 3497–3506, 2010—The squat is one of the most frequently used exercises in the ﬁeld of strength and conditioning. Considering the complexity of the exercise and the many variables related to performance, understanding squat biomechanics is of great importance for both achieving optimal muscular development as well as reducing the prospect of a training-related injury. Therefore, the purpose of this article is 2-fold: ﬁrst, to examine kinematics and kinetics of the dynamic squat with respect to the ankle, knee, hip and spinal joints and, second, to provide recommendations based on these bio- mechanical factors for optimizing exercise performance.\n\nKEY WORDS squat, biomechanics, kinetics, kinematics\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nT he squat"]}

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.\n\nF or more than a century, inventors and sci-","Miller et al.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

To overcome this shortcoming of fuzzy broad learning system, this article builds a novel model of fuzzy broad learning system based on acceler- ating amount by introducing the accelerating amount into fuzzy broad learning system.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","2722\n\nIEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, VOL. 25, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2020\n\nReal-Time Locomotion Mode Recognition and Assistive Torque Control for Unilateral Knee Exoskeleton on Different Terrains\n\nXiuhua Liu and Qining Wang , Senior Member, IEEE","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury. Experimental data is presented that indicates the ability of the proposed con- trol architecture to provide appropriate user-initiated control of sitting, standing, and walking. The authors also provide a link to a video that qualitatively demonstrates the user’s ability to independently control basic movements via the proposed control method.

The authors suggest that two foundational elements are required to do so effectively. First, the exoskeleton system must be capable of reliable real-time gait phase detection, in order to determine the nature of gait assistance to provide. Second, in gait phases or circumstances in which the exoskeleton provides minimal assistance, the passive dynamics of the exoskeleton should not hinder the individual (i.e., should have the capability to minimally interfere with gait dynamics). As such, the exoskeleton system should be capable of actively compensating for its passive dynamics, namely the inertial, gravitational, and frictional effects it imposes on the user. This paper describes the implementation of these two foundational elements (real-time gait phase detection and active cancellation of passive dynamics) on a prototype lower limb exoskeleton, and provides experimental data demonstrating their respective efficacy.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","opEN\n\nData DEScRiptoR\n\nLower-limb kinematics and kinetics during continuously varying human locomotion\n\nEmma Reznick Nicholas P.

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives.

INTRODUCTION"],"neg":["Abstract— Aiming at the problem that the rigid exoskeleton has insufficient compliance due to mechanical vibration in the human-robot cooperation motion and can only move within a small range of designed trajectories, the user's active motion intention cannot be fully expressed. In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility. In extension and flexion, the highest γ values (γ reflects the intensity of the subject's initiative) are 3.390 and 3.705, respectively.

Collins1\n\nAbstract Background: Reducing the energy cost of running with exoskeletons could improve enjoyment, reduce fatigue, and encourage participation among novice and ageing runners. Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."]}

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton.

The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs).

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","1636\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 60, NO. 6, JUNE 2013\n\nEffects of Robotic Knee Exoskeleton on Human Energy Expenditure Andrej Gams∗, Tadej Petriˇc, Tadej Debevec, and Jan Babiˇc"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","2722\n\nIEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS, VOL. 25, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2020\n\nReal-Time Locomotion Mode Recognition and Assistive Torque Control for Unilateral Knee Exoskeleton on Different Terrains\n\nXiuhua Liu and Qining Wang , Senior Member, IEEE"]}

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"," Abstract— Individuals with lower limb amputations show higher metabolic costs during ambulation than able-bodied individuals. This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I.

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller"]}

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

However, no studies have investigated how quickly individuals with neuromuscular disabilities adapt to assistance across different time scales, which makes experimental design challenging. The goal of this case series was to evaluate how individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) adapt to untethered powered plantar-flexor assistance within and across exoskeleton practice sessions. To assess inter-visit adaptation, one participant with mild CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level (GMFCS) I) completed 112 minutes of exoskeleton walking practice across four visits. This participant’s preferred level of assistance increased across practice sessions, and metabolic assessment indicated reduced acclimation time and improved walking economy; across visits, metabolic cost decreased by 18% during walking with exoskeleton assistance and by 13% while wearing the exoskeleton in an unassisted condition"]}

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure"," Abstract— Active lower limb exoskeletons can provide assistance to the lower extremities and may drastically improve the walking abilities of millions of individuals with gait impairments. However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","PreliminarystudyofonlinegaitrecognizerforlowerlimbexoskeletonsJunwonJang,KyungrockKim,JusukLee,BokmanLim,Joon-KeeChoandYoungboShimAbstract—Weproposeanoveltwo-tiergaitrecognizerusingaminimalnumberofmechanicalsensorsbuiltintoalowerlimbexoskeleton.Theaimofthisrecognizeristoofferone-stepselectionofoneoftheactionsascending,descending,andlevelwalkingduringﬁvegaits(stairascent\/descent,slopeascent\/descent,levelwalking).Theproposedrecognizerisexe-cutedatthemomentoffootcontactasestimatedbyaninertialmeasurementunit(IMU)onthepelviswithoutusingdirectfootsensors.Theproposedrecognizerselectsthegaitbyusingtherelationsbetweentheanglesformedbythehipandkneejointsduringthelaststep.Asthisstudyconstitutespreliminaryworkforlowerlimbexoskeletons,weusedahipexoskeletonintegratedwithtwowirelessIMUsontheshanktosetupthelowerlimbexoskeletonsensorconﬁguration.ExperimentswereusedtoevaluateIMU-basedfootcontactestimationwithrespecttoafootsensorbasedonaforce-sensitiveresistor(FSR)forstairs,slopes,andlevelground.Inaddition,weevaluatedtheperformanceoftheproposedtwo-tiergaitrecognizerbyusingtwohealthymalesubjectsinvariousgaitenvironments.I","2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Singapore, May 29 - June 3, 2017\n\nSimulating Gait Assistance of a Hip Exoskeleton: Case Studies for Ankle Pathologies\n\nBokman Lim, Seungyong Hyoung, Jusuk Lee, Keehong Seo, Junwon Jang, and Youngbo Shim\n\nAbstract—We propose a simulation framework for gait assistance with ankle pathologies. We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait."]}

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility. In extension and flexion, the highest γ values (γ reflects the intensity of the subject's initiative) are 3.390 and 3.705, respectively. I"]}

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology."]}

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nRemoving energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking\n\nMichael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*","1636\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 60, NO. 6, JUNE 2013\n\nEffects of Robotic Knee Exoskeleton on Human Energy Expenditure Andrej Gams∗, Tadej Petriˇc, Tadej Debevec, and Jan Babiˇc"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","Fylstra et al.

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","IEEEROBOTICSANDAUTOMATIONLETTERS.PREPRINTVERSION.ACCEPTEDFEBRUARY,20181AnklePathologicGaitAssistanceofaHipExoskeleton:SimulationandExperimentBokmanLim∗1,SunHeeHwang∗2,SeungyongHyung1,JusukLee1,YoungboShim1,andByung-okChoi2Abstract—Thispaperpresentsasimulationframeworkforhipassistanceinanklepathologies.Weﬁrstconstructedtheneuromuscularwalkingmodel,thendesignedtheparametersforassistancetorquesforstanceandswinglegs.Theparametervaluesweredeterminedbycarryingoutdynamicoptimizationswhichtakesintoaccountthehuman-exoskeletoninteractivedynamics.Thecasestudiesinvolvedabnormalgaitswith1)footdrop,and2)footdropandplantarﬂexionfailure.WeconductedclinicaltrialsonCharcot-Marie-Tooth(CMT)patientswithvariousdegreeofseverityusingtheassistancetorquegeneratedbythesimulation.Weevaluatedthegaitspeedfordifferentgaittypeswithdifferentassistancetimings.Ourresultsshowthattheassistancecustomizationofvariousgaittypesisessentialformaximizingtheassistanceeffect.IndexTerms—Physicalhuman-robotinteraction,wearablerobots,pathologicgaitsimulation,assistancecustomization.I.INTRODUCTIONABNORMALgaitpatternswithanklepathologiesareobservedinpatientsorelderlywithgaitdisorders"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system"]}

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","Journal of Physics: Conference SeriesBiomechanics of front and back squat exercisesTo cite this article: A A Braidot et al 2007 J.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers. Measurements from these experiments indicate that the control approach effectively combines the respective efforts of the motor and muscle, such that good control performance is achieved, with substantial torque and energy contributions from both the biological and non-biological actuators. I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external"]}

We ﬁrst construct the neu- romuscular walking model, then design the parameters for assistance torques for stance and swing legs. The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations which takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. The simulated energy expenditure and kinematic data are compared with the real data. Case studies involve abnormal gaits with 1) foot drop, 2) foot drop and plantarﬂexion failure. We evaluate the gait efﬁciency and walking speed for the different gait types. Our result shows that each gait type should have a different assistance strategy (timing and magnitude) compared to the assistance strategy of a normal gait.","Journal of Physics: Conference SeriesBiomechanics of front and back squat exercisesTo cite this article: A A Braidot et al 2007 J.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking","2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR) Toronto, Canada, June 24-28, 2019\n\nExoProsthetics: Assisting Above-Knee Amputees with a Lightweight Powered Hip Exoskeleton\n\nMarshall K. Ishmael, Minh Tran, Student Member, IEEE, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE\n\n(cid:2)\n\nAbstract(cid:2) In this paper, we explore the effect of residual hip assistance in one above-knee amputee subject using a novel lightweight powered hip exoskeleton. Differently from a powered prosthesis, a powered hip exoskeleton adds mass proximally. Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton. Experimental results show 20.5% reduction of PCI when walking with the powered hip exoskeleton. I.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure","This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.

However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","6640\n\nIEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS, VOL. 9, NO. 7, JULY 2024\n\nDesign-Modeling and Control of a Novel Wearable Exoskeleton for Lower-Limb Enhancement\n\nShuang Qiu , Student Member, IEEE, Zhongcai Pei\n\n, Jia Shi\n\n, Xu Zhang, Chen Wang, and Zhiyong Tang"]}

With its two-layered unique structure, the frame is flexible in certain locations and directions, and stiff at certain other locations, so that it can fit well to the wearer’s thigh and transmit the assisting torque without joint loading. The paper describes the basic mechanics of this 3D flexible frame and its stiffness characteristics. We implemented the 3D flexible frame on a gait enhancing mechatronic system and conducted experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism is verified by simulation and experiments. I.

Powell, Aaron J. Young, Anirban Mazumdar"," Abstract— Active lower limb exoskeletons can provide assistance to the lower extremities and may drastically improve the walking abilities of millions of individuals with gait impairments. However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system","This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg."]}

Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton."],"neg":["SCIENCE ROBOTICS | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nEXOSKELETONS\n\nImproving the energy economy of human running with powered and unpowered ankle exoskeleton assistance Kirby A.

Lewek4,\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Ankle exoskeletons offer a promising opportunity to offset mechanical deficits after stroke by applying the needed torque at the paretic ankle. Because joint torque is related to gait speed, it is important to consider the user’s gait speed when determining the magnitude of assistive joint torque. We developed and tested a novel exoskeleton controller for delivering propulsive assistance which modulates exoskeleton torque magnitude based on both soleus muscle activity and walking speed. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the resulting exoskeleton assistance on post-stroke walking performance across a range of walking speeds."]}
